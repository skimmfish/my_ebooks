## Introduction
Glad you are here to read some of the most mind boggling concepts in Christianity. The issues with spiritual matters Christianity
can not be appeciated as well as it should be if its not spiritually articulated and that is why I'm coming up with this topic.
In this series, you will learn the following concepts and the result of that would be outstanding if you will carefully follow
all I'm going to be sharing in this book.
Chapter 1 talks about the baptism of the Holy Spirit as an experience every christian must have after salvation
and it is an experience that must be sought out for lest you run short of the real energy that your new life requires.
Chapter 1 also talks about what differentiates the Baptism of the Holy Spirit from the new birth experience. Many new converts are 
confused about this subject, and whatsoever that creates a gap in your understanding will certainly have effect on your Christian journey going forward.
